For this project, I worked on classifying loan risk using logistic regression, with the goal of determining the creditworthiness of borrowers. I started by reading the provided lending data into a Pandas DataFrame and split the data into training and testing sets. I set the "loan_status" column as the target labels, where a value of 0 represents a healthy loan and a value of 1 indicates a high-risk loan. After that, I trained a logistic regression model using the training data and made predictions on the test set. To evaluate the modelâ€™s performance, I generated a confusion matrix and printed a classification report, which provided key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Finally, I summarized my findings and provided a recommendation regarding the model's effectiveness in predicting loan risk.
